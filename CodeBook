The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition.

1. Download the dataset
      Datasets imported individually and columns were renamed for clarity

2. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
set (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
labels (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
Merged_Data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, labels and set using cbind() function

3. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
    TidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting Merged_Data, selecting only columns: subject, 
        code and the measurements where the column name includes "mean" or "std".

3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Entire numbers in code column of the TidyData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
    code column in TidyData renamed into activities
    All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
    All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
    All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
    All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
    All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
    All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
    FinalData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject,
    after grouped by subject and activity.

6. Export FinalData into FinalData.txt file.n
